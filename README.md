# Sars-Cov-2 wastewater monitoring data reported by the Canton of Zurich

### Scope
As part of the cantonal SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring, the __Health Department of the Canton of Zurich__ publishes measured samples from twelve wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) distributed __throughout the Canton of Zurich__. The measurements are based on the EAWAG (Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology) project "SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater". Further information: https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sww/projects/sars-cov2-in-wastewater/

__Please note:__ <br>
- The measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater are partly subject to considerable measurement errors. Therefore, an interpretation of the wastewater measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to the case numbers is only meaningful over longer periods of time and depends on the scale chosen. Consequently, the data should be interpreted with caution, as there is a large scope for misinterpretation.
- Information about the twelve WWTPs is available in [this resource](jump to respective resource below), including their abbreviation, full designation and location (cantonal district), and indicating their respective catchment area (number of connected residents).

### Update
Wastewater samples are taken three times a week at the twelve wastewater treatment plants. The analysis of the data is usually published a few days later.
